## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version Control Systems also known as VCS’s make the world of web development so much easier. They keep track of all versions of a document that a user works on or creates. It is one main repository for all the projects files. One of the best parts of version control systems is that they allow teams to edit and update the same projects without overwriting each other’s work. This is beneficial because it allows companies to continuously make money if they experience problems during development. Due to the fact, they are able to easily go back and look at where the mistakes are and fix them and not have to take much time out of production to fix the problems.
2. Git is one of the most popular version control systems, even though it has been around for a little over ten year. It’s popularity is due to its simple design, efficiency, speed, and other aspects. Git started out as open source software project called the Linux Kernel. The Linux Kernel existed for about eleven years, however at the end of its lifetime it started breaking down causing the use of it to no longer be free. Therefore, a couple of developers from the Linux Kernel decided to create their own version control system using knowledge they gained from working with the Linux Kernel. This creation of theirs is know know as Git and has helped millions of people.
3. Git is locally enabled. This means that you are able to version control items to Git anywhere in the world as long have you have access to a desktop. Having this ability is important because it makes working on projects as a team so much smoother which increases productivity. I think every who needs to use a version control system should use Git. Git automatically notes all of the actions the user does. The notes consist of who changed  the files, when they were changed, what about them was new or different, and merge changes to the same file. All of these notes create a revision history that can be used as a reference when a team is experiencing problems in their project.
4. Git is different from all of the other version control systems because of how it thinks and stores data. Instead of thinking of the data stored by users as a list of changes it takes a “snapshot” of the stored data as a smaller file system. Every time the user saves, Git takes a “snapshot” of what their files look like at the moment and stores a reference to that “snapshot”.  However, if no changes have occured it does not store another “snapshot” of the previous identical snapshot but instead just puts a link to the previous snapshot since it’s identical. The “snapshot” aspect of Git is helpful because there will never be duplicates of files making it easier to keep track of changes. 
5. There are over a hundred different commands that can be used for Git. These commands do the simple task of allowing users to do various different actions inside of Git. Three examples of these basic git commands that users must use within the version control system to connect their local repository to the remote repository are “git add”, “git commit”, and  “git push”. The “git add” command adds new files to the staging area. It is similar to when someone in a grocery store is adding items to their shopping cart. The “git commit” command takes the files and saves them to the local repository. It is similar to when someone in a grocery store are purchasing their items. The “git push” command uploads everything in the user’s local repository to the remote repository. It is similar to when the person is leaving the grocery store with their purchases.
